# Exerlog - Log your quarantine workouts ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

## About

Just a fullstack app made with express / react during a pandemic to help me get back into habit of coding in my free time as well as something to help people keep track of their at home workouts.

## Development

- Install dependencies with `npm` or `yarn`
- (Running backend and frontend with one command or docker should follow next)
